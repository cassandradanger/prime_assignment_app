        <h2>About Prime</h2>
        <h3>Our Team</h3>
        <h3>Our Values</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Students First: Prime is a built around helping you change your life for the better.</li>
            <li>Empathy > Engineering: It doesn’t matter how clever your solution is if you don’t understand the problem you’re solving. Seek first to understand.</li>
            <li>Experiment Fast: Like our students, we learn by doing. We believe rapid iteration, an experimental approach and meaningful feedback loops are an engine for success.</li>
            <li>Strength in Diversity: It’s hard to think different when everyone’s the same. We believe that broadening the pool of software engineering talent will strengthen the industry.</li>
            <li>Be Humble: People who know everything can’t learn anything, we ask our students and ourselves to be open to learning by embracing our ignorance.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Our Origin Story</h3>
        <p>Though we wish we could say we were bit by a radioactive software engineer, our origin is a bit more mild mannered. Prime was founded by the creators of The Nerdery, a custom software development company whose super power is the collective intelligence of its 500+ employees. Inspired by the challenge that The Nerdery, its partners and clients were facing in finding qualified software engineers, Prime was created to do something to help Minnesota’s tech industry develop the talent they need to drive innovation in software.</p>
